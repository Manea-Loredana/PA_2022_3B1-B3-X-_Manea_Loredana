// Enums are transformed by the compiler into classes;
// they contain some other methods
//Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.
//An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants
//Notes: that they should be in uppercase letters
