Compulsory (1p)  done

Bonus (2)        continue
```
1. ✨Compulsory (1p)
- Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes Network, Node, Computer, Router, Switch. The natural ordering of the nodes is given by their names.
- Create the interfaces Identifiable and Storage. The classes above must implement these interfaces accordingly.
- The Network class will contain a List of nodes.
- Create and print all the nodes in the network (without the time costs).
3. ✨ Homework (2p)
- Each node will contain a Map representing the time costs. Create and print the complete network in the example.
- Create a default method in the interface Storage, that is able to return the storage capacity in other units of storage (megabyte, kilobyte, byte).
- In the Network class, create a method to display the nodes that are identifiable, sorted by their addresses.
- Implement an efficient agorithm to determine all the shortests times required for data packets to travel from an identifiable node to another.
3. ✨Bonus (2p)
- In addition to the time cost, each link between two network nodes has a probability of failure. You may want to read this.
- Implement an efficient agorithm to determine the safest route for a packet to travel between two given nodes.
- Generate random network instances with known optimum and test your algorithm using JUnit or other framework.



## Laboratorul 2
```sh
Compulsory (1p)  done
Homework (2p)    done
Bonus (2)        i will do this another time
```

3. ✨Bonus (2p)
- Use the time package in order to describe the start and the end time of the events.
- Implement the DSatur graph coloring algorithm.
- Generate large random instances and:
   ~ compare the solutions generated by Greedy and DSatur algorithms;
   ~ analyze the performance of your algorithm (running times, memory consumption). Identify the hot-spots in your code.
